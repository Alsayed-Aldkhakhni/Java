Q2.1:
a) A(n) [ Opening curly brace '{' ]  begins the body of every method, and a(n) [ Closing curly brace '}' ] ends the body of every method.
b) You can use the [ if ] statement to make decisions.
c) [ // ] begins an end-of-line comment.
d) [ Tab, spaces, indentations] are called white space.
e) [ Keywords] are reserved for use by Java.
f) Java applications begin execution at method [ main ].
g) Methods [ print, println, printf ] and display information in a command window.

Q2.2:
a) Comments cause the computer to print the text after the [//] on the screen when the program executes.
   * False, it ignores the text after it until the line's end.
b) All variables must be given a type when theyâ€™re declared.
   * True, To allocate the suitable number of bytes.
c) Java considers the variables number and NuMbEr to be identical.
   * False, Java is case-sensitive, which diffrentiate between upper and lower case.
d) The remainder operator (%) can be used only with integer operands.
   * False, It can be used with fractional numbers as [12.5, 0.20]
e) The arithmetic operators *, /, %, + and - all have the same level of precedence.
   * False, 1st 3 has the higher precedence and the last 2 has the lower one.

Q2.3:
a) Declare variables c, thisIsAVariable, q76354 and number to be of type int.
   * int c, thisIsAVariable, q76354, number;
b) Prompt the user to enter an integer.
   * System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
c) Input an integer and assign the result to int variable value.
   * int iVar = input.nextInt();
d) Print "This is a Java program" on one line in the command window.
   * System.out.println("This is a Java program");
e) Print "This is a Java program" on two lines in the command window.
   * System.out.printf("%s%n%s", "This is a Java", "program");
f) If the variable number is not equal to 7, display "The variable number is not equal to 7". 
   * if(number != 7) System.out.println("The variable number is not equal to 7");

                  *******************************************************************************************

Q2.4:
a) if (c < 7); <-- Because of this ";" the compiler sees it as an "if condition" followed by an empty statement. so, 
   System.out.println("c is less than 7"); <-- this statement will be printed either the condition is false since it doesn't belong to it.

b) if (c => 7) <-- This is a syntax error since the operator is [>=] not [=>].
   System.out.println("c is equal to or greater than 7");

                  *******************************************************************************************
Q2.5:
a) State that a program will calculate the product of three integers.
   * // This program gonna calculate the product of 3 ints.
b) Create a Scanner called input that reads values from the standard input.
   * Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
c) Declare the variables x, y, z and result to be of type int.
   * int x, y, z, result;
d) Prompt the user to enter the first integer.
   * System.out.print("Enter the 1st int: ");
e) Read the first integer from the user and store it in the variable x.
   * x = input.nextInt();
f) Prompt the user to enter the second integer.
   * System.out.print("Enter the 2nd int: ");
g) Read the second integer from the user and store it in the variable y.
   * y = input.nextInt();
h) Prompt the user to enter the third integer.
   * System.out.print("Enter the 3rd int: ");
i) Read the third integer from the user and store it in the variable z.
   * z = input.nextInt();
j) Compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y and z, and assign the result to the variable result.
   * result = x * y * z;
k) Use System.out.printf to display the message "Product is" followed by the value of the variable result.
   * System.out.printf("Product is: %d", result);

                  *******************************************************************************************

Q2.6: Using Exercise 2.5, write a complete program that calculates and prints the product of three integers.

import java.util.Scanner; // import declaration, to use 'Scanner' class.
public class Product      // class declaration.
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);     // read data from the user at the keyboard.
        System.out.print("Enter the 1st integer: ");// prompt him to enter the first integer.
        int x = input.nextInt();                    // read the integer.
        
        System.out.print("Enter the 2nd integer: ");// prompt for the 2nd one.
        int y = input.nextInt();                    // read the second integer.
        
        System.out.print("Enter the 3rd integer: ");// prompt for the 3rd.
        int z = input.nextInt();                    // read the third integer.
        
        int result = x * y * z;                     // carry out the calculation.
        
        System.out.printf("The product is: %d%n", result); // print the value to the user.
    }
}
