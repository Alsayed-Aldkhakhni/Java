Q3.1:
a) Each class declaration that begins with keyword [public] must be stored in a file that
    has exactly the same name as the class and ends with the .java filename extension.
b) Keyword [class]in a class declaration is followed immediately by the class’s name.
c) Keyword [new] requests memory from the system to store an object, then calls the
    corresponding class’s constructor to initialize the object.
d) Each parameter must specify both a(n) [data type] and a(n) [parameter name].
e) By default, classes that are compiled in the same directory are considered to be in the
    same package, known as the [default package].
f) Java provides two primitive types for storing floating-point numbers in memory: [float, double]
g) Variables of type double represent [double] floating-point numbers.
h) Scanner method [nextDouble] returns a double value.
i) Keyword public is an access [modifier].
j) Return type [void] indicates that a method will not return a value.
k) Scanner method [nextLine] reads characters until it encounters a newline character,
    then returns those characters as a String.
l) Class String is in package [java.lang].
m) A(n) [import declaration] is not required if you always refer to a class with its fully 
    qualified class name.
n) A(n) [floating-point number] is a number with a decimal point, such as 7.33, 0.0975 or 1000.12345.
o) Variables of type float represent [single-precision] floating-point numbers.
p) The format specifier [%f] is used to output values of type float or double.
q) Types in Java are divided into two categories [primitives and referenced]

Q3.2:                       
a) By convention, method names begin with an uppercase first letter, and all subsequent
    words in the name begin with a capital first letter.
   * False, the best practice is to make the 1st char in the method name to be lower
      and each of the first one in the subsequent words to be upper.
b) An import declaration is not required when one class in a package uses another in the same package.
   * True, such a package is called default package.
c) Empty parentheses following a method name in a method declaration indicate that the method does not 
    require any parameters to perform its task.
   * True
d) A primitive-type variable can be used to invoke a method.
   * False, the referenced variables can.
e) Variables declared in the body of a particular method are known as instance variables
    and can be used in all methods of the class.
   * False, Those are variables declared in the class outside any method.
f) Every method’s body is delimited by left and right braces ({ and }).
   * True.
g) Primitive-type local variables are initialized by default.
   * False, You have to do it yourself.
h) Reference-type instance variables are initialized by default to the value null.
   * True.
i) Any class that contains public static void main(String[] args) can be used to execute an app.
   * True.
j) The number of arguments in the method call must match the number of parameters in
    the method declaration’s parameter list.
   * True 
k) Floating-point values that appear in source code are known as floating-point literals and
    are type float by default. 
   * False, Type double by default.

Q3.3: What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?

* local variable:
  - It is declared inside a method body.
  - Has no default value.
  - Its value is lost after the method does its task.
  - You can't use it before being initialized.
  - Can only be visible inside the method it's declared in.

* instance variable: 
  - It is declared inside a class body outside any method.
  - Has a default value based on its type [primitive or referenced].
  - Its value remains as long as the object exist.
  - You can use it before being initialized since it is initialized implicitly.
  - Its visibality is based on its access modifier
    - if it is private, it will be visible inside the whole class..
    - if it is public,  it will be visible any-where.

Q3.4: Explain the purpose of a method parameter. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

* purpose of parameter:
  - Used to provide the method with piece of data needed to accomplishes its task.
  
* parameter vs argument:
  - Parameter is the variable we said at the build of the class that method will take,
  - Argument  is the variable or the literal value passed at the runtime in the driver class.
