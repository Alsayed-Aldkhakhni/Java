* (Based on Section 8.14)
  Explain the notion of package access in Java. Explain the negative
  aspects of package access.

* The classes of the same package can access those members of each other
  if they have a reference to the object or the class is loaded into the 
  memory while execution when they are defined with no access modifier.

* This technique kills the concept of data hiding, since all the classes
  that can access those members [data] will have no problem with modifying
  them even with invalid values.
