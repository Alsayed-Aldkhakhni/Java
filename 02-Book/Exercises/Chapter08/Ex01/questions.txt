8.1) Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
    a) A(n) [static import on demand] imports all static members of a class.
    b) String class static method [formate] is similar to method System.out.printf, 
       but returns a formatted String rather than displaying a String in a command window.
    c) If a method contains a local variable with the same name as one of its class’s fields, 
       the local variable [shadows] the field in that method’s scope.
    d) The public methods of a class are also known as the class’s [public services] 
       or [public interfaces].
    e) A(n) [Qualified-name class import] declaration specifies one class to import.
    f) If a class declares constructors, the compiler will not create a(n) [default constructor].
    g) An object’s [toString9()] method is called implicitly when an object appears in code where
       a String is needed.
    h) Get methods are commonly called [accessor] or [query method].
    i) A(n) [predicate (e.g. isEmpty())] method tests whether a condition is true or false.
    j) For every enum, the compiler generates a static method called [values()]
       that returns an array of the enum’s constants in the order in which they were declared.
    k) Composition is sometimes referred to as a(n) [has-a] relationship.
    l) A(n) [Enum] declaration contains a comma-separated list of constants.
    m) A(n) [static] variable represents class-wide information that’s shared by all the objects
       of the class.
    n) A(n) [single static import] declaration imports one static member.
    o) The [least privilege] states that code should be granted only the amount
       of privilege and access that it needs to accomplish its designated task.
    p) Keyword [final] specifies that a variable is not modifiable after initialization
       in a declaration or constructor.
    q) A(n) [type-import-on-demand] declaration imports only the classes that the program
       uses from a particular package.
    r) Set methods are commonly called [mutator] because they typically change a value.
    s) Use class [java.math.BigDecimal] to perform precise monetary calculations.
