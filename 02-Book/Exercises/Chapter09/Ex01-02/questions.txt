9.1) Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
    a)[Inheritance] is a form of software reusability in which new classes acquire
       the members of existing classes and embellish those classes with new capabilities.
    b) A superclass’s [protected, public] members can be accessed in the superclass
       declaration and in subclass declarations.
    c) In a(n) [Is-a] relationship, an object of a subclass can also be treated as an object of
       its superclass.
    d) In a(n) [Has-a] relationship, a class object has references to objects of other classes as
       members.
    e) In single inheritance, a class exists in a(n) [hierarchal] relationship with its subclasses.
    f) A superclass’s [public] members are accessible anywhere that the program has a reference
       to an object of that superclass or to an object of one of its subclasses.
    g) When an object of a subclass is instantiated, a superclass [no-argument constructors] is called
       implicitly or explicitly.
    h) Subclass constructors can call superclass constructors via the keyword [super].


9.2) State whether each of the following is true or false. If a statement is false, explain why.
    a) Superclass constructors are not inherited by subclasses. [True].
    b) A has-a relationship is implemented via inheritance. [False],
       A has-a relationship is implemented via composition.
    c) A Car class has an is-a relationship with the SteeringWheel and Brakes classes. [False],
       A Car class has a has-a relationship with the SteeringWheel and Brakes classes.
    d) When a subclass redefines a superclass method by using the same signature,
       the subclass is said to overload that superclass method. [False],
       This is called overriding.
