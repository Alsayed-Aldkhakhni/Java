Q1.1:
a) Computers process data under the control of sets of instructions called [ computer programgs. ]
b) The key logical units of the computer are the [ Input unit, Output unit, Memory unit, ALU, CU, Storage unit ].
c) The three types of languages discussed in the chapter are [ Machine language {0's, 1's},
    assembly language {some lables as load, store, add, sub}, High-level language {as Java, CPP, C, Python.} ]
d) The programs that translate high-level language programs into machine language are called [ Compilers. ].
e) [ Android ] is an operating system for mobile devices based on the Linux kernel and Java.
f) [ Release Candidate ] software is generally feature complete, (supposedly) bug free and ready for use by the community.
g) The Wii Remote, as well as many smartphones, use a(n) [ geroscope ]  which allows the device to respond to motion.

Q1.2:
a) The command [ java  ] from the JDK executes a Java application.
b) The command [ javac ] from the JDK compiles a Java program.
c) A Java source code file must end with the [ *.java ] file extension.
d) When a Java program is compiled, the file produced by the compiler ends with the [ *.class ] file extension.
e) The file produced by the Java compiler contains [ Byte codes ] that are executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Q1.3:
                          [data hiding] <-------+
                                                |
a) Objects enable the design practice of [ encapsulation ] although they may know how to communicate with one another
    across well-defined interfaces, they normally are not allowed to know how other objects are implemented.
 * "Encapsulation" is about grouping data and methods together.
 * "Data hiding  " you prevent direct access to the internal state of an object, usually by marking fields
    private or protected and controlling access to them using public methods (like getters and setters).

b) Java programmers concentrate on creating [ classes ] which contain fields and the set of methods that manipulate
    those fields and provide services to clients.
c) The process of analyzing and designing a system from an object-oriented point of view is called 
    [ Object-Oriented Analysis and Design {OOAD} ]
d) A new class of objects can be created conveniently by [ inheritance ] the new class (called the subclass)
    starts with the characteristics of an existing class (called the superclass) possibly customizing them and
    adding unique characteristics of its own.
e) [ Unified Modeling Language {UML} ] is a graphical language that allows people who design software systems 
     to use an industry-standard notation to represent them.
f) The size, shape, color and weight of an object are considered [ Fields or attributes ] of the object’s class.

                   *************************************************************************************
Q1.4:
a) The logical unit that receives information from outside the computer for use by the computer is the [ Input unit ].
b) The process of instructing the computer to solve a problem is called [ Programming. ]
c) [Assembly-language] is a type of computer language that uses Englishlike abbreviations for machine-language
     instructions.
d) [Output unit] is a logical unit that sends information which has already been processed by the computer to various
     devices so that it may be used outside the computer.
e) [Memory unit] and [Secondary storage units] are logical units of the computer that retain information.
f) [ALU] is a logical unit of the computer that performs calculations.
g) [ALU] is a logical unit of the computer that makes logical decisions.
h) [High-level] languages are most convenient to the programmer for writing programs quickly and easily.
i) The only language a computer can directly understand is that computer’s [Machine language {0's and 1's}]
j) [CPU] is a logical unit of the computer that coordinates the activities of all the other logical units.

Q1.5:
a) The [Java] programming language is now used to develop large-scale enterprise applications, to enhance the
    functionality of web servers, to provide applications for consumer devices and for many other purposes.
b) [C language] initially became widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system.
c) The [TCP] ensures that messages, consisting of sequentially numbered pieces called bytes, were properly
    routed from sender to receiver, arrived intact and were assembled in the correct order.
d) The [C++] programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Laboratories.

                   *************************************************************************************
Q1.6:
a) Java programs normally go through five phases [Edit, Save, Load, Verify, Execute].
b) A(n) [IDE] provides many tools that support the software development process, such as editors for writing
    and editing programs, debuggers for locating logic errors in programs, and many other features.
c) The command java invokes the [JVM] which executes Java programs.
d) A(n) [VM] is a software application that simulates a computer, but hides the underlying operating system
    and hardware from the programs that interact with it.
e) The [Class Loader] takes the .class files containing the program’s bytecodes and transfers them to primary memory.
f) The [Bytecode Verifier] examines bytecodes to ensure that they’re valid.

                   *************************************************************************************
Q1.7:
* Java uses couple of transelators:
  1) An interpreter to transelate the source code to bytecodes.
  2) And a compiler to transelate the bytecodes to machine code.

                   *************************************************************************************

1.8 A wrist watch.
* Object: Is a specific watch as [Casio A159W-N1DF Classic Digital].
* Attributes : [Price, color, screen size, number of buttons, led color, number of batteries, frame material, weight, module, production year.]
* Behaviors  : [Alarm ring at specified time, seconds changes each second, minutes each 60 seconds, hours each 60 minute, eadit the status if
                pressing the buttons.]
* Class      : [Such a watch has a design drawings and their fields and methods supposed to have/do.]
* Inheritance: [Wrist watch inherits from alarm watch the buttons functions with a little difference in the size and shape,
                also may inherits the Clockwise or the 7-sigments digits if it is digital one, but the wriste watch is portable,
                light in weight, smaller and wearable not as alarm watch, so, both watch has common behaviour and the other has differeces.]
* Modeling   : [Engineering drwaings should be modeling method to such entity.]
* Messages   : [Pressing the button or rolling the Clockwise is as giving the watch a message to change its state.]
* Encapsulation: [It includes and wrap its parts inside the frame.]
* Interface  : [Is is interacting with the external world by its Clockwise or buttons if it's digital.]
* Information hiding: [We can interface with the watch using its Clockwise or buttons but we don't know how it is implemented or how 
                       it does that.]
