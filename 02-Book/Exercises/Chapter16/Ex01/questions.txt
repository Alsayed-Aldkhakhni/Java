16.1) Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
      a) A(n) [Iterator object] is used to iterate through a collection 
         and can remove elements from the collection during the iteration.
      b) An element in a List can be accessed by using the element’s [index].
      c) Assuming that myArray contains references to Double objects, [wrraping "Auto-boxing"] 
         occurs when the statement "myArray[0] = 1.25;" executes.
      d) Java classes [ArrayList, Vector] provide the capabilities of arraylike 
         data structures that can resize themselves dynamically.
      e) If you do not specify a capacity increment, the system will [doublicate]
         vector's size each time additional capacity is needed.
      f) You can use a(n) [unmodifiableCollection static method.] to create a collection
         that offers only read-only access to others while allowing read–write access to yourself.
      g) Assuming that myArray contains references to Double objects, [Auto-unboxing] occures when
         statement "double number = myArray[0];" executes.
      h) Collections algorithm [disjoint] determines if two collections have elements in common.
