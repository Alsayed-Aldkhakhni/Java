16.5) Explain why inserting additional elements into a Vector object 
      whose current size is less than its capacity is a relatively fast 
      operation and why inserting additional elements into a Vector
      object whose current size is at capacity is a relatively slow operation.

* Since if there is no room to insert the next item in, the vector expand the 
  capacity by re-allocating new memory space and coping all items in the old
  reference and insert the new item.
