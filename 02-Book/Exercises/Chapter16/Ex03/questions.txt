16.3) Define each of the following terms:
      a) Collection : It is an interface that is the parent of collections [List, Set, Map, ArrayList].
      b) Collections: It is a class extends the Collection interface contains some pre-defined static
                      methods used to sorting, searching and coping.
      c) Comparator : It is an interface that is used to specifiy the ordering apporach. 
      d) List       : It is an interface that stores items and those may be dupblicated.
      e) load factor: It is the ratio of the filled slots to the total cells of the hash table.
                      or two different keys are hashed into the same cell [index] in the array.
      f) collision  : It is a situation happend when the target slot to insert in is not empty.
      g) space/time 
         trade-off 
         in hashing : It is choosing between the memory utilization and program execution's speed
                      since the collisions make the hashing more and more to find an empty room
                      to insert the item, time consuming - memory utilization, but if we decreased
                      the load factor, less hasing [less time] and less memory utilization. 
      h) HashMap    : It is a Collection that stores its key-value pairs in a hash table.
